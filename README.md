Batch effect characterization

What do real batch effects look like? Here we aim to characterize batch effects observed under different known conditions in real data. We want to quantitatively and qualitatively describe observed batches according to the following criteria:

Size? How much of the variance can be attributed to the batch effect?
Celltype-specificity? How celltype/cluster specific are batch effects? Differences in sample variation between batches?
Gene-specificity? How do they effect genes? Single genes? All genes? Which genes?
We want to characterize batches from different sources as: * Different media conditions (unwanted conditional variation) * Different sequencing protocols used (unwanted technical variation) * Different patients (unwanted biological variation)
